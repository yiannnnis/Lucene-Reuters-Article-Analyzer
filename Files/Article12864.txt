<TITLE>BP <BP> ADR'S TO REPRESENT MORE ORDINARY SHARES</TITLE>
<BODY>British Petroleum Co Plc's proposed
capitalization share issue, announced earlier today in London,
will result in each of the company's ADRs representing 12
ordinary shares, up from the current four, a BP North America
Inc spokesman said.
    He explained that the proposed capitalization share issue,
which is subject to the approval of shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting to be held April 30, immediately
following the annual general meeting, is effectively a
three-for-one stock split.

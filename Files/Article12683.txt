<TITLE>U.S SENATE OVERRIDES REAGAN'S HIGHWAY BILL VETO</TITLE>
<BODY>The Senate overrode President
Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway funding bill, 67-33.
    The measure now becomes law. It was a major personal loss
for Reagan, who came to the Capitol earlier in the day to
campaign for support.

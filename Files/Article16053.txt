<TITLE>PAKISTAN GETS 70 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN</TITLE>
<BODY>mln-dlr, 20-year loan to assist Pakistan in a project designed
to improve power plant efficiency.
    Noting that a shortage of power constrains Pakistan's
economic development, the Bank said one objective of the
project is to provide at least 200 megawatts of additional
generating capacity.
    Another objective is to improve the efficiency with which
hydrocarbons are used by Pakistan's Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA) in power production, it said. One effect of
this would be reduced atmospheric pollution.

<TITLE>WESTLAND TO CUT A THIRD OF HELICOPTER WORKFORCE</TITLE>
<BODY>U.K. Helicopter maker <Westland Plc> will
reduce the 6,000 workforce of its helicopter division by around
a third over the next few weeks, a company spokesman said.
    He said the decision was in part the result of a 400 mln
stg government order for military helicopters announced
earlier.
    The spokesman said the order had reduced the number of
redundancies necessary but was not large enough to avoid job
losses. The total group workforce is 11,000. The company was
rescued last year by a consortium of United Technologies Corp's
<UTX.N> Sikorsky unit and Fiat SpA <FIAT.MI>.

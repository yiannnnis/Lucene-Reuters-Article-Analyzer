<TITLE>MOZAMBIQUE SEEKS ADDITIONAL 160 MLN DLRS IN AID</TITLE>
<BODY>Mozambique appealed for an additional
160 mln dlrs in emergency humanitarian aid to help the country
through a severe economic crisis.
    Prime Minister Mario Machungo told a news conference
several countries -- notably the U.S., Britain and Italy -- had
already made pledges towards this new appeal.
    The U.S. offered grain amounting to a third of the nation's
annual consumption, Britain offered eight mln stg and Italy was
expected to offer 30 to 35 mln dlrs, he said.
    The country's "extremely severe economic crisis" stemmed from
continued fighting with "armed bandits" -- a euphemism for
anti-government guerrillas -- and a series of floods which have
destroyed crops, Machungo said.
    An estimated four million people require emergency care.

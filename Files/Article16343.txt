<BODY>DSC Communications Corp said it amended
an existing long term supply contract with MCI Communications
Corp <MCIC> for deliveries of a new tandem switch.
    Deliveries of the switch, the DEX 600E, are scheduled to
begin in third quarter of 1988 and end by year-end 1989, the
telecommunications systems company said.

existing 600 switches, it said.
    Under the amended agreement, DSC will also deliver signal

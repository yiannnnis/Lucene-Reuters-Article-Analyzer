<TITLE>FDA APPROVES CEPHRADINE BY ZENITH <ZEN></TITLE>
<BODY>Zenith Laboratories Inc said the
Food and Drug Administration approved Cephradine, an
antibiotic, for marketing.
    The maker of generic drugs, less costly versions of brand
name drugs that have lost their patents, said Cephradine has
been available as Velosef from Squibb Corp <SQB> and Anspor
from a SmithKline Beckman Corp <SKB> unit.
    Earlier this week the company said it received FDA
marketing approval for Cefadroxil, another antibiotic, which it
said it will market once questions "relating to patent
applicability are resolved."
